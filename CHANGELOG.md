# 1.0.0

* The library is stable, warning-less and production-ready

* Thanks everybody for contributing and all the great PRs.
  Since the library is stable enough and we almost never had to fix things,
  it's time to release 1.0.

* Documentation could be better, and we encourage you to write some.
  Thanks [@orta](https://github.com/orta) for initiating that.
